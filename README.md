#  ROB 550 Robotics System Lab - Bot lab

In this project we developed a mbot-classic ground driving forklift robot that uses motion control, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and path planning to compete in a variety of competitions. Several key components are required for the system to work properly, including wheel speed motion control for differential drive motion control, integration of odometry and LiDAR sensor data into action and sensor models for Monte-Carlo localization, A* Path Planning for exploring unknown areas, and mechanism design, manufacturing, and integration for forklift capabilities. Our code implemented these techniques and features developed and integrated to implement the obstacle avoiding, crate lifting, and terrain exploring robot. The performance is validated on tasks requiring dead-reckoning path following, 2D occupancy map generation, unknown map exploration, and stacking crates.
